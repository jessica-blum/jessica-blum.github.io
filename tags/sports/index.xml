      <description>If you couldn’t already tell, Gonzaga was not the champion of the NCAA March Madness Tournament this year. If they were, this would be more of a joyful piece in which you could take what I did and maybe recreate it for yourself.
However, I would advise that only bits and pieces of work may be worth taking up in future work. I did end up in the top 85th percentile with my bracket, the best out of the eight brackets I produced through ESPN for this year’s slate of games.</description>
