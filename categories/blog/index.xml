      <description>Our sportsbook open and closed around the NBA Playoffs (picture by CBS Sports).
 There comes a time in one’s life that the lure of betting tempts the brain and gives one the feeling of accomplishment or entertainment. For some, that comes with turning of age and seeing others do it. For some, it can be the location of a vacation such as Las Vegas.
For me, the lure never came.</description>

      <description>Gonzaga left the tournament with tails stuch between their hind legs.
 If you couldn’t already tell, Gonzaga was not the champion of the NCAA March Madness Tournament this year. If they were, this would be more of a joyful piece in which you could take what I did and maybe recreate it for yourself.
However, I would advise that only bits and pieces of work may be worth taking up in future work.</description>
